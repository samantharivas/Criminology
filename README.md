# Police Fatalities

This project is a part of the ADS-505 course in the Applied Data Science Program at the University of San Diego. 

-- Project Status: Completed


## Project Introduction:
In California, our local nonprofit is dedicated to addressing the increasing fatalities involving Law Enforcement Officers (LEOs). We aim to differentiate intentional and non-intentional use of deadly force in these incidents.


## Project Objective:
Our project's objective is to develop and compare classification models (e.g., Neural Network, Naive Bayes, Gradient Boosting, etc.) to improve resource allocation during emergency responses and enhance officer training. This will enhance public safety and law enforcement effectiveness through data-driven insights.

## Project Description:
Our project's core objective is to build, evaluate, and compare various classification models, including but not limited to Neural Networks, Naive Bayes, Gradient Boosting, Linear Discriminant Analysis, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Decision Trees. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, we intend to achieve several key outcomes:

Enhanced Resource Allocation: By accurately categorizing incidents as intentional or unintentional use of deadly force, we can optimize the allocation of resources during emergency responses. This ensures that the right level of support is dispatched to critical situations promptly.

Improved Officer Training: Identifying patterns and insights in the data can help determine which officers might benefit from additional training. This targeted approach to training equips law enforcement officers with the skills and knowledge needed to handle challenging and high-stress scenarios effectively.

Public Safety: Ultimately, our project aims to contribute to improved public safety by providing law enforcement agencies with valuable insights into the nature of incidents involving LEOs. This data-driven approach can inform strategies to reduce fatalities, increase community safety, and enhance public trust in law enforcement.

Through rigorous data analysis and machine learning, we aspire to make a meaningful impact in reducing fatalities and creating safer communities. Our project stands at the intersection of data science, public safety, and social responsibility, aiming to drive positive change in California and potentially serve as a model for addressing similar challenges in other regions.
